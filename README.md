This git repository is slides for my talk on developping and debugging with WordPress at the [Vancouver WordPress meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-WordPress-Meetup-Group/events/56494732/).

With a very low barrier to entry, developing with WordPress has become particularly popular in the past few years. However, this sometimes means that standards and best practices aren't well respected. The aim of this talk is to (re)introduce developers to some of WordPress' coding standards and general best practices, as well provide you with tools to become a better developer. This will be a resourceful presentation for anyone beginning/interested in/or even long-time developing with WordPress.

In the spirit of open-source, the slides are published here on GitHub and anyone is welcome to contribute before, during or after the talk.

You can preview the slides at [jkudish.com/yvrwpmeetup](http://jkudish.com/yvrwpmeetup) (they get rebuilt everytime the repo is updated).

If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request or open an issues for questions or comments. You can also reach me more privately at [info@jkudish.com](info@jkudish.com) if you'd like.
